<h2> Steak is Steak!</h2>

<p>In the mood to impress at dinner (but strapped for time)? We can all agree—there’s nothing more impressive than a perfectly cooked <strong> <em> steak </em></strong>. 
    They’re kind of the end-all-be-all of romantic date night options, and are pretty perfect for casual weeknight dinners too. </p>

<p>While we do love the ambiance at our local steakhouse, we also like being able to cook up restaurant-level meals at home. </p>

<h2>Incredients</h2>

<ul> 
<li>1/3 c. extra-virgin olive oil </li>
<li>1/4 c. reduced-sodium soy sauce </li>
<li> 2 Tbsp. lime (or lemon) juice</li> 
<li>2 Tbsp. packed light brown sugar </li>
<li> 2 lb. flank steak</li>
<li> Kosher salt</li>
<li> Freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol> 
<li>In a large bowl, whisk together olive oil, soy sauce, lime juice, and brown sugar. Add steak and toss until coated. Marinate for at least 30 minutes, up to 2 hours. </li>
<li>Remove steak from marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Season lightly with salt (remember that there's soy sauce in the marinade) and pepper. </li>
<li> To grill: Preheat grill to medium-high. Place steak on grill and cook to your liking, starting at 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. (Cooking time will vary due to thickness of your steak.) Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature—130°F for medium-rare. </li>
<li>To broil: Preheat oven broiler to high. Place steak on a sheet pan and cook, turning once halfway through, until cooked to your liking, starting at 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. (Cooking time will vary due to thickness of your steak.) Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature—130°F for medium-rare. Let rest before slicing and serving. </li>
</ol>
