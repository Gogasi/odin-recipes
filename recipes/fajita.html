<li> 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
<li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
<li>3 bell peppers, thinly sliced</li>
<li> 2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li> 1/2 lime</li>
<li> 1/2 tablespoon chili powder</li>
<li> 1/2 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
<li> 1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li> 1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>

<li>sour cream</li>
<li>pico de gallo</li>
<li>avocado</li>
</ul>

<h2> <strong> Steps </strong></h2>

<ol>
<li> Season the chicken. Generously sprinkle the fajita seasoning on both 
    sides of the chicken and use your fingers to press it in.</li>
<li>Cook the chicken. Heat a large skillet 
    over medium heat and lightly coat it with a drizzle of olive oil or avocado oil. 
    Sear the chicken breasts for about 7-8 minutes on each side. Then remove them 
    from the pan and let them rest for a few minutes before slicing into strips. </li>
<li> Saute the bell peppers and onion. While the chicken is cooking, cut the bell 
    peppers and onions into thin slices. Then saute them in the same skillet over 
    medium heat for a few minutes until caramelized. You’re essentially making fajita veggies.</li>
<li> Mix together. Add the chicken back into the skillet, squeeze fresh 
    lime juice on top and stir everything together.</li>
    <li> Wrap it up. Serve immediately with tortillas and extra toppings.</li>
